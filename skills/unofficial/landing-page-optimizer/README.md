# Landing Page Optimizer

Conversion-focused landing page playbook for Claude agents. Use it when auditing or improving marketing pages, pricing/hero sections, or experiment plans.

## How to use
- Collect: URL/screenshots, audience/ICP, primary offer + CTA, traffic sources/intent, baseline metrics (CVR, bounce, time on page), objections, brand voice, constraints.
- Run the workflow in `SKILL.md`: baseline → first-screen check → fast diagnosis → prioritized recs → rewritten copy → experiment plan → instrumentation/QA.
- Deliverables: 3–7 prioritized fixes (with “why” and acceptance), ready-to-ship hero/proof/FAQ copy, 3–5 A/B ideas with metrics, analytics + QA checklist.

## Ready reference (copy blocks)
- **Hero template**: “Headline: [Outcome] for [Audience] in [Timeframe]. Subhead: We do it by [mechanism] so you can [benefit]. CTA: [Do the thing] →. Support: stat or 1–2 logos; optional ghost secondary CTA.”
- **Social proof**: “Proof that it works” + 3 quotes with outcome + role, a metric tile (+X% conversion/–Y% CAC/+Z% AOV), 4–6 logos.
- **Form**: 3–5 fields max, safety badges, time-to-complete, progressive disclosure for advanced fields.

## Example outputs
- **SaaS (B2B trials)**  
  - Headline: “Ship features 30% faster without adding headcount.”  
  - Subhead: “We automate release QA with AI-run smoke tests so teams focus on shipping.”  
  - Proof: “+18% conversion in 45 days” tile; logos of 4 peer companies; testimonial with role.  
  - Primary CTA: “Start free trial”; Secondary: “See pricing” (ghost).
- **E-commerce (single SKU)**  
  - Headline: “Clinically better sleep in 14 nights.”  
  - Subhead: “Layered foam + cooling cover tested on 1,200 sleepers; ships free, 100-night guarantee.”  
  - Proof: star rating + UGC quote + “Trusted by 250k sleepers” stat.  
  - Primary CTA: “Add to cart”; Microcopy: “Ships today · Free returns.”
