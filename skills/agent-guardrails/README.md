# agent-guardrails

Operational guardrails that keep coding agents aligned with repo contracts and safety checks.

## Overview

A safety-first skill that enforces non-negotiable practices across tooling, verification, versions, integration layers, env/config, import-time side effects, and high-risk actions. It keeps automation disciplined and pauses for explicit approval when changes carry broad impact.
