# Skills Library

This repository hosts self-contained AI skills. Each skill packages domain guidance, runnable examples, and trigger metadata so agents can load just what they need.

## Layout

- `skills/<skill-id>/` — one folder per skill (you can also namespace, e.g., `skills/anthropic/<skill-id>/` or `skills/unofficial/<skill-id>/`)
  - `README.md` — scope, usage, and maintenance notes for the skill
  - `SKILL.md` — name/description/trigger metadata
  - `AGENTS.md` — compiled guide an agent can load directly
  - `metadata.json` — version, owner, and reference links
  - `rules/` — source rule files and templates

## Current Skills

- `vercel-react-best-practices` — React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<skill-id>/` (or `skills/<namespace>/<skill-id>/`) and add a `README.md` describing the scope and intended users.
2. Add `SKILL.md` with the frontmatter (name, description, triggers) your agent runtime expects.
3. Place your guidance in `rules/` (include a `_template.md` if helpful) and commit any compiled outputs such as `AGENTS.md`.
4. Capture ownership details in `metadata.json` (version, organization, references).
5. Update the **Current Skills** list above so discoverability stays up to date.
